<div class="textblock"><p>The Payment Card Industry Payment Application Data Security Standard (PCI PA-DSS) is comprised of fourteen requirements that support the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which was founded by the major card brands in June 2005, set these requirements in order to protect cardholder payment information. The standards set by the council are enforced by the payment card companies who established the Council: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa, Inc.</p>
<p>PCI PA-DSS is an evolution of Visas Payment Application Best Practices (PABP), which was based on the Visa Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP). In addition to Visa CISP, PCI DSS combines American Express Data Security Operating Policy (DSOP), Discover Networks Information Security and Compliance (DISC), and Ma80149503sterCards Site Data Protection (SDP) into a single comprehensive set of security standards. The transition to PCI PA-DSS was announced in April 2008. In early October 2008, PCI PA-DSS Version 1.2 was released to align with the PCI DSS Version 1.2, which was released on October 1, 2008. On January 1, 2011, PCI PA-DSS Version 2.0 was released. This extends the PCI DSS Version 1.2, which was released on October 1, 2008 and is effective as of January 1, 2011.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="applicability"></a>
Applicability</h1>
<p>The PCI PA-DSS applies to any payment application that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data as part of authorization or settlement, unless the application would fall under the merchants PCI DSS validation. It is important to note that PA-DSS validated payment applications alone do not guarantee PCI DSS compliance for the merchant. The validated payment application must be implemented in a PCI DSS compliant environment. If your application runs on Windows XP, you are required to turn off Windows XP System Restore Points.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="whatdoespadssmeantoyou"></a>
What Does PA-DSS Mean to You?</h1>
<p>The following table provides opening points to cover in any discussion with merchants on data storage.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="padss1.png" alt="padss1.png"/>
</div>
 <h1><a class="anchor" id="thirdpartyapplications"></a>
Third Party Applications</h1>
<p>The end-to-end transaction process, beginning with entry into the third party application until the response from the payment engine is returned, must meet the same level of compliance. In order to claim the third party application is end-to-end compliant, the application would need to be submitted to a QSA for a full PA-DSS audit.</p>
<p>The end user and/or P.O.S. developer can integrate and be compliant in the processing portion of a payment transaction. A brief review (given below) of the PA-DSS environmental variables that impact the end user merchant can help the end user merchant obtain and/or maintain PA-DSS compliance. Environmental variables that could prevent passing an audit include without limitation issues involving a secure network connection(s), end user setup location security, users, logging and assigned rights. Remove all testing configurations, samples, and data prior to going into production on your application.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="padssguidelines"></a>
PA-DSS Guidelines</h1>
<p>The following PA-DSS Guidelines are being provided by ID TECH as a convenience to its customers. Customers should not rely on these PA-DSS Guidelines, but should instead always refer to the most recent PCI DSS Program Guide published by PCI SSC.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>1. Sensitive Data Storage Guidelines </dt><dd>Do not retain full magnetic stripe, card validation code or value (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), or PIN block data. 1.1 Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (even if encrypted): Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 1.1.1 through 1.1.3. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2</dd></dl>
<p>Note: By prohibiting storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization, the assumption is that the transaction has completed the authorization process and the customer has received the final transaction approval. After authorization has completed, this sensitive authentication data cannot be stored.</p>
<p>1.1.1 After authorization, do not store the full contents of any track from the magnetic stripe (located on the back of a card, contained in a chip, or elsewhere). This data is alternatively called full track, track, track 1, track 2, and magnetic-stripe data.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the following data elements from the magnetic stripe may need to be retained:</p>
<ul>
<li>The accountholders name,</li>
<li>Primary account number (PAN),</li>
<li>Expiration date, and</li>
<li>Service code</li>
<li>To minimize risk, store only those data elements needed for business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: See PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for additional information. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2.1</p>
<p>1.1.2 After authorization, do not store the card-validation value or code (three-digit or four-digit number printed on the front or back of a payment card) used to verify card-not-present transactions. Note: See PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for additional information. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2.2</p>
<p>1.1.3 After authorization, do not store the personal identification number (PIN) or the encrypted PIN block.</p>
<p>Note: See PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for additional information. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2.3</p>
<p>1.1.4 Securely delete any magnetic stripe data, card validation values or codes, and PINs or PIN block data stored by previous versions of the payment application, in accordance with industry-accepted standards for secure deletion, as defined, for example by the list of approved products maintained by the National Security Agency, or by other State or National standards or regulations. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2</p>
<p>Note: This requirement only applies if previous versions of the payment application stored sensitive authentication data.</p>
<p>1.1.5 Securely delete any sensitive authentication data (pre-authorization data) used for debugging or troubleshooting purposes from log files, debugging files, and other data sources received from customers, to ensure that magnetic stripe data, card validation codes or values, and PINs or PIN block data are not stored on software vendor systems. These data sources must be collected in limited amounts and only when necessary to resolve a problem, encrypted while stored, and deleted immediately after use. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.2</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>2. Protect stored cardholder data</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>2.1 Software vendor must provide guidance to customers regarding purging of cardholder data after expiration of customer-defined retention period. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.1</p>
<p>2.2 Mask PAN when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed).</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This requirement does not apply to those employees and other parties with a legitimate business need to see full PAN;</li>
<li>This requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder datafor example, for point-of-sale (POS) receipts. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.3</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 Render PAN, at a minimum, unreadable anywhere it is stored, (including data on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-way hashes based on strong cryptography with associated key management processes and procedures</li>
<li>Truncation</li>
<li>Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)</li>
<li>Strong cryptography with associated key management processes and procedures. The MINIMUM account information that must be rendered unreadable is the PAN. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.4</li>
</ul>
<p>The PAN must be rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored, even outside the payment application. Note: Strong cryptography is defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms.</p>
<p>2.4 If disk encryption is used (rather than file- or column-level database encryption), logical access must be managed independently of native operating system access control mechanisms (for example, by not using local user account databases). Decryption keys must not be tied to user accounts. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.4.2</p>
<p>2.5 Payment application must protect cryptographic keys used for encryption of cardholder data against disclosure and misuse. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.5</p>
<p>2.6 Payment application must implement key management processes and procedures for cryptographic keys used for encryption of cardholder data. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.6</p>
<p>2.7 Securely delete any cryptographic key material or cryptogram stored by previous versions of the payment application, in accordance with industry-accepted standards for secure deletion, as defined, for example the list of approved products maintained by the National Security Agency, or by other State or National standards or regulations. These are cryptographic keys used to encrypt or verify cardholder data. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 3.6</p>
<p>Note: This requirement only applies if previous versions of the payment application used cryptographic key materials or cryptograms to encrypt cardholder data.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>3. Provide secure authentication features</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>3.1 The payment application must support and enforce unique user IDs and secure authentication for all administrative access and for all access to cardholder data. Secure authentication must be enforced to all accounts, generated or managed by the application by the completion of installation and for subsequent changes after the "out of the box" installation (defined at PCI DSS Requirements 8.1, 8.2, and 8.5.88.5.15) for all administrative access and for all access to cardholder data. PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 8.1, 8.2, and 8.5.88.5.15</p>
<p>Note: These password controls are not intended to apply to employees who only have access to one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction. These controls are applicable for access by employees with administrative capabilities, for access to servers with cardholder data, and for access controlled by the payment application. This requirement applies to the payment application and all associated tools used to view or access cardholder data. 3.1.10 If a payment application session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, the application requires the user to re-authenticate. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 8.5.15.</p>
<p>3.2 Software vendors must provide guidance to customers that all access to PCs, servers, and databases with payment applications must require a unique user ID and secure authentication. PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 8.1 and 8.2</p>
<p>3.3 Render payment application passwords unreadable during transmission and storage, using strong cryptography based on approved standards</p>
<p>Note: Strong cryptography is defined in PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 8.4</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>4. Log payment application activity</dt><dd>4.1 At the completion of the installation process, the out of the box default installation of the payment application must log all user access (especially users with administrative privileges), and be able to link all activities to individual users. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 10.1</dd></dl>
<p>4.2 Payment application must implement an automated audit trail to track and monitor access. PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 10.2 and 10.3</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>5. Develop secure payment applications</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>5.1 Develop all payment applications in accordance with PCI DSS (for example, secure authentication and logging) and based on industry best practices and incorporate information security throughout the software development life cycle. These processes must include the following: PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 6.3</p>
<p>5.1.1 Live PANS are not used for testing or development. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 6.4.4.</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation of all input (to prevent cross-site scripting, injection flaws, malicious file execution, etc.)</li>
<li>Validation of proper error handling</li>
<li>Validation of secure cryptographic storage</li>
<li>Validation of secure communications</li>
<li>Validation of proper role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
</ul>
<p>5.1.2 Separate development/test, and production environments</p>
<p>5.1.3 Removal of test data and accounts before production systems become active development. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 6.4.4</p>
<p>5.1.4 Review of payment application code prior to release to customers after any significant change, to identify any potential coding vulnerability. Removal of custom payment application accounts, user IDs, and passwords before payment applications are released to customers</p>
<p>Note: This requirement for code reviews applies to all payment application components (both internal and public-facing web applications), as part of the system development life cycle required by PA-DSS Requirement 5.1 and PCI DSS Requirement 6.3. Code reviews can be conducted by knowledgeable internal personnel or third parties.</p>
<p>5.2 Develop all web payment applications (internal and external, and including web administrative access to product) based on secure coding guidelines such as the Open Web Application Security Project Guide. Cover prevention of common coding vulnerabilities in software development processes, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injection flaws, with particular emphasis on SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS) OS Command Injection, LDAP and Xpath injection flaws, as well as other injection flaws.</li>
<li>Buffer Overflow.</li>
<li>Insecure cryptographic storage.</li>
<li>Insecure communications.</li>
<li>Improper error handling.</li>
<li>All HIGH vulnerabilities as identified in the vulnerability identification process at PA-DSS Requirement 7.1.</li>
<li>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>
<li>Improper access control such as insecure direct object references, failure to restrict URL access and directory traversal.</li>
<li>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The vulnerabilities listed in PA-DSS Requirements 5.2.1 through 5.2.9 and in PCI DSS at 6.5.1 through 6.5.9 were current in the OWASP guide when PCI DSS v1.2 / PCI DSS v2.0 (01/01/10) were published. However, if and when the OWASP guide is updated, the current version must be used for these requirements.</p>
<p>5.3 Software vendor must follow change control procedures for all product software configuration changes. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 6.4. 5.The procedures must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation of impact</li>
<li>Management sign-off by appropriate parties</li>
<li>Testing functionality to verify the new change(s) does not adversely impact the security of the system. Remove all testing configurations, samples, and data before finalizing the product for production.</li>
<li>Back-out or product de-installation procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>5.4 The payment application must not use or require use of unnecessary and insecure services and protocols (for example, NetBIOS, file-sharing, Telnet, unencrypted FTP must be secured via SSH, S-FTP, SSL, IPSec and other technology to implement end to end security). PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 2.2.2</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>6. Protect wireless transmissions</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>6.1 For payment applications using wireless technology, the wireless technology must be implemented securely. Payment applications using wireless technology must facilitate use of industry best practices (for example, IEEE 802.11i) to implement strong encryption for authentication and transmission. Controls must be in place to protect the implemented wireless network from unknown wireless access points and clients. This includes testing the end users wireless deployment on a quarterly basis to detect unauthorized access points within the system. Change wireless vendor defaults, including but not limited to default wireless encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP community strings. Maintain a detailed updated hardware list. The end to end wireless implementation must be end to end secure. The use of WEP as a security control was prohibited as of 30 June 2010. PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, 4.1.1, 6.2, 11.1a-e and 11.4a-c.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>7. Test payment applications to address vulnerabilities</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>7.1 Software vendors must establish a process to identify newly discovered security vulnerabilities (for example, subscribe to alert services freely available on the Internet) and to test their payment applications for vulnerabilities. Any underlying software or systems that are provided with or required by the payment application (for example, web servers, third-party libraries and programs) must be included in this process. Remove all test configurations, samples, and data after testing and before promoting the changes to production. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 6.2</p>
<p>7.2 Software vendors must establish a process for timely development and deployment of security patches and upgrades, which includes delivery of updates and patches in a secure manner with a known chain-of-trust, and maintenance of the integrity of patch and update code during delivery and deployment.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>8. Facilitate secure network implementation</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>8.1 The payment application must be able to be implemented into a secure network environment. Application must not interfere with use of devices, applications, or configurations required for PCI DSS compliance (for example, payment application cannot interfere with anti-virus protection, firewall configurations, or any other device, application, or configuration required for PCI DSS compliance). PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>9. Cardholder data must never be stored on a server connected to the Internet</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>9.1 The payment application must be developed such that the database server and web server are not required to be on the same server, nor is the database server required to be in the DMZ with the web server. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 1.3.7</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>10. Facilitate secure remote software updates</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>10.1 If payment application updates are delivered securely via remote access into customers systems, software vendors must tell customers to turn on remote-access technologies only when needed for downloads from vendor and to turn off immediately after download completes. Alternatively, if delivered via VPN or other high-speed connection, software vendors must advise customers to properly configure a firewall or a personal firewall product to secure authentication using a two factor authentication mechanism. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 8.3</p>
<p>10.2 If payment application may be accessed remotely, remote access to the payment application must be authenticated using a two factor authentication mechanism. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 8.3</p>
<p>10.3 Any remote access into the payment application must be done securely. If vendors, resellers/integrators, or customers can access customers payment applications remotely, the remote access must be implemented securely. PCI Data Security Standard Requirements 1, 8.3 and 12.3.9</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>11. Encrypt sensitive traffic over public networks</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>11.1 If the payment application sends, or facilitates sending, cardholder data over public networks, the payment application must support use of strong cryptography and security protocols such as SSL/TLS and Internet protocol security (IPSEC) to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks. Examples of open, public networks that are in scope of the PCI DSS are: The Internet Wireless technologies Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 4.1</p>
<p>11.2 The payment application must never send unencrypted PANs by end-user messaging technologies (for example, e-mail, instant messaging, and chat). PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 4.2</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>12. Encrypt all non-console administrative access</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>12.1 Instruct customers to encrypt all non-console administrative access using technologies such as SSH, VPN, or SSL/TLS for web-based management and other non-console administrative access. Telnet or remote login must never be used for administrative access. PCI Data Security Standard Requirement 2.3</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>13. Maintain instructional documentation and training programs for customers, resellers, and integrators</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>13.1 Develop, maintain, and disseminate a PA-DSS Implementation Guide(s) for customers, resellers, and integrators that accomplishes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses all requirements in this document wherever the PA-DSS Implementation Guide is referenced.</li>
<li>Includes a review at least annually and updates to keep the documentation current with all major and minor software changes as well as with changes to the requirements in this document.</li>
</ul>
<p>13.2 Develop and implement training and communication programs to ensure payment application resellers and integrators know how to implement the payment application and related systems and networks according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide and in a PCI DSS-compliant manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the training materials on an annual basis and whenever new payment application versions are released.</li>
</ul>
